                                This project was the end result of a portion of my study abroad trip to Poland. Together 
                                with 13 other students from Northeastern, we worked with around 28 students from the 
                                Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology to develop games from game jam concepts 
                                centering on topics of Polish historical or cultural significance. My team was a collective 
                                group of 10 students split across the programming, art, and music disciplines. Together, we 
                                overhauled the game jam concept and developed Oil City in Unity, a city-builder factory game in line 
                                with Factorio where you must maintain the Polish oil industry through its historical hardships 
                                and global triumphs.

                                In this project, I took on the role of a programmer and game designer. The main thing I contributed
                                to the project was the implementation of the pipe system and time manager.

                                In order for the game to function, there needed to be some system in charge of delegating game ticks to objects that 
                                needed them. This included various time-related managers such as the TimelineManager, in addition to the main mechanic
                                of the game: oil flow. To create a generalized tool, I made a TimeManager script that would store its registered objects
                                in a forest list; the roots of the trees being the only gameobjects to receive the ticks. For objects like the Woodcutter's house,
                                it would remain in the list as a singleton tree. For things like the Train Station (often the root of the oil system), it would
                                receive the tick, then recurse down its members to pass the invocation on to them as well. This kept every system deterministic in 
                                their execution order (i.e. in an oil system, the consumer wouldn't somehow go before the producer), which made the game easy to debug
                                and play.

                                I was in charge of making the pipes, a crucial part of the game. To best fit with the requests of players and QA testers, I had
                                to rework the system's implementation to allow for different types of connections alongside ambiguous connections and temporarily invalid
                                connections. Pipes had to flow between two Flowable structures (a building or another pipe), maintain a valid connection between
                                said structures (i.e. flowing from a valid direction into a valid direction and containing the expected fluid type of either Kerosene or Oil 
                                for that kind of connection), and possess the ability to be "flipped" on demand in case a player made a mistake in placing them down.

                                <br><br>
                                This was a complicated mechanic that gave me a bit of trouble. The problems I had mainly revolved around pipes of zero or one length (created by
                                connecting to adjacent pipes), and creating understandable syntax for documenting the obscure problems that popped up. The former proved to create
                                a lot of issues due to my definiton of pipes have a left/right-hand side endpoints. A singleton pipe had the two positions be the exact same, meaning
                                that a further distinction with pipe flow direction AT those endpoints was necessary, from which made it determinable what tile the singleton pipe was
                                flowing in to or out from.

                                <br><br>In retrospect, a lookup table of tile positions to Flowable objects would've been a better approach for this 
                                system rather than a hard-coded tree as it would've made the coupling/decoupling issues trivial to solve, if only 
                                a bit more tedious to access.

                                powerful in their modularity. I evaluated several approaches to implementing move data, but
                                settled with Scriptable Objects and repurposing Unity’s Mechanim State Machine Animation States.

                                I used ripped sprites from <i>Scott Pilgrim VS The World: The Game</i> so I could focus on the
                                programming. Every script is custom-written in Unity, with the only package being InputSystem.

                                this package because I wanted to have a non-programmatical coupling between input and behaviors. With InputSystem's 
                                serializable unityevents for input, this was a clear choice.

                                In order to achieve a smooth gameplay feel, I wrote my own input-buffering system to prevent buttons from being lost and
                                to allow players to input actions during the downtime of another. This buffer used two lists in parallel to keep track of 
                                input history and decay period before expiration, using binary insertion to add inputs quickly to the lists. I didn't use
                                a priority queue for the input histories based on the decay time left because the queue would need to reorganize itself
                                often. Additionally, the queue would need to remove items that may not be at the front in the event of an input expiration.
                                This would've gotten messy, so I stuck with two paired lists and the invariant that they were related by index.

                                As mentioned in the project description, I used sprites ripped from a game in order to develop the framework. These sprites were organized on
                                a sprite sheet in uneven columns and rows, making the slicing very difficult. To circumvent the time required to take manual screenshots of each frame,
                                I wrote a python script to detect and flood-fill individual sprites, writing the data to separate image files. This allowed me to drastically cut down on the

                                When designing this kind of game, I had considered using AnimationEvents in the past as a means of
                                storing information for callbacks and triggering functions. However, this would prove to be a bad design choice
                                as the information was hard-coded into animation clips, making them impossible to reuse without copying the 
                                stored information. Additionally, the animation event system uses reflection to activate callbacks, a practice
                                which scales poorly when lots of components or children are in the object's hierarchy.
                                <br> <br>
                                To fix this, I used a SO design of "Tracks" with "Sequences". Sequences contained Tracks which contained KVpairs
                                of frame timestaps paired with a generic value. A hitbox sequence for example would have hitbox data at certain frames,
                                indicating that at the given frame timestamp, that hitbox should appear. In order to run a Sequence, I used Unity's Mechanim
                                State Machine monobehavior base script as a sort of launching point. Animation states would have their respective clips for certain
                                attacks, but would all use the same state script. This state script was in charge of executing the attack's respective SequenceSO, running
                                through every Track with every Animator update.

                                To help with the development of Tracks and Sequences, I created a dev scene in Unity to "scrub" through an animation and its Sequence.
                                This would play back the animation and Sequence in parallel, sending the event invocations from the Sequence to debug mocks of the same
                                components, which would report the information to the console or draw things in the scene to represent the gathered data.
                                <br> This was very helpful in cutting down the amount of time I spent wading through code and SOs for bugfixing, and I think
                                it looks pretty neat.

                                It wasn't really necessary for the game's mechanic, but I wanted cheeky NPCs, so I made
                                a dialogue system.
                                As one does. It was a fully-custom made system that allowed for variable text speeds,
                                in-editor dialogue editing,
                                and easily-extensible world-events during dialogue, such as animations, flag triggers,
                                gameobject toggles, etc.

                                A multi-semester project for a class I took called <b>Game Studio</b>. In a mock studio

                                primarily
                                contributed to the codebase with custom utility tools (e.g. facilitating puzzle design

                                line

                                implementing dialogue through the external <b>Inky</b> application. I worked in a small

                                implementation details and creating how-to guides for the dialogue writers.

                                The original code for moving elements such as platforms was hard-coded to only allow two
                                points of movement, and ONLY platforms
                                could move. This was pretty limiting, so I redesigned the moving element system to be a
                                generic component that allowed for multiple
                                anchor points to traverse between, accessible in the editor. Additionally, I added
                                different wrapping types so designers could
                                easily change the movement, behavior, and start position of platforms.

                                In order to help level designers in the creation of "power lines" to represent energy
                                flowing in our puzzle system, I created an
                                editor script tool that would use the line renderer component to generate a prefab with
                                the baked line mesh between a set of points.
                                The line generation used a custom-written pathfinding algorithm and supported several
                                creative parameters. I also created guides to use
                                for this tool as well as the dialogue implementation pipeline for artists and dialogue
                                writers.

                                character controller that was different from the standard implementation in two ways:
                            <ol>
                                <li>1 - The state machine was composition-based, meaning states could be pulled in and
                                    out
                                    of
                                    the state machine willy-nilly at runtime with no adverse/unpredicatable effects.
                                </li>
                                <li>2 - The player used a floating-capsule implementation as opposed to the
                                    ground-contact
                                    capsule implementation which often had implementation quirks with stairs or
                                    elevation.

                                state machine so that states could be added and removed at runtime. I was met with a lot
                                of difficulties about execution order and
                                "assessing" information about the world, but it was a fun challenge. There are a lot of
                                parameters to tweak for this implementation, too.

                                The end result of my senior project. My goal was to create a small, polish,
                                proof-of-concept
                                for
                                a puzzle game all about attraction and repulsion. To do this, I learned new tools like
                                ShaderGraph and the HDRP rendering pipeline. I also used practices like Inheritance and
                                modular
                                OoD in order to create game mechanics like my reusable puzzle system and the

                                system. The latter allowed me to extend the game's original mechanic to affect the
                                player as
                                well, which I was pleasantly surprised by.

                                shaders work. I created some basic shaders for illuminated tiles, water, and "disslution grids" (dissolving energy fields).

                                Much like the rest of my projects, I used Unity and Blender for the game engine, asset creation, and animation creation. This was
                                the first time I used the InputSystem package as well.

                                This game was made with puzzles a la <i>Portal 2</i>; objects would give or receive power. This led me to create an extensible
                                interface and class structure to easily create new kinds of puzzle objects (a button, a dissolving gate, a cube-former, etc.)
                                and connect them together in the scene.

                                This was the first time I wrote a character controller for Unity from scratch. I made a non-kinematic rigidbody player
                                controller that I could easily impart external forces to through my main game mechanic in order to make the movement
                                feel fluid and natural while also having easy control over parameters. I also made it use a state machine to avoid 
                                disorganized code, which worked out pretty well for my first time.

                                Additionally, I utilized camera overlays to produce a User HUD. It was a cool technique that taught me a lot about how
                                cameras render and cull objects, including how view frustums sometimes cull things within view and how to avoid that.

                                The final project for our <b>Object-Oriented Design</b> class. With two other students, we
                                made
                                a JavaFX-based bullet journal using design patterns (MVC). The goal of the project was to
                                create
                                an easily extensible codebase with modular implementations that would be compounded upon
                                with
                                further iterations of the assignment. One of the lightbox images includes the UML diagram we
                                made for the code layout of our project.

                                Working in a group of three allowed for me to get some experience working with git source control. We used separate branches per person, merging
                                when relevant tasks overlapped. Java and JavaFX were used to create the application, with Gradle as the main library/asset manager and build tool. It
                                also provided build tasks for unit testing, which our team used to validate the functionality of the backend.

                                In order to implement the functionality of being able to read and write schedules to files, I worked with FXML's file browser
                                dialog to select file paths, using java's File I/O library to read from and write to selected paths. Additionally, we implemented
                                password locks for these files, preventing them from being read until a valid password was given.
                                <br> <br>
                                For the user interface design, we used javaFX for its ease of implementation and coupling with back-end functionality. We ended up
                                forgoing the tradition MVC design in favor of custom root UI controllers that extended layout elements. This allowed us to easily 
                                create UI at runtime without the worry of having to set up connections and the like.
                                <br> <br>
                                Additionally, we wanted to avoid having a complicated user interface for our program. To achieve this, we made use of many custom dialog 
                                popups so that information would be displayed on throw-away windows that wouldn't clutter the main view.
